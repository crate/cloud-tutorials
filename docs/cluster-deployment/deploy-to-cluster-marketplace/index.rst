Deploy a cluster via the Marketplace offers
===========================================

Here you can find the tutorials for subscribing to CrateDB Cloud via one of the
two supported Marketplace SaaS offers.

The process is very straightforward, you only need to subscribe to the CrateDB
Cloud product on the relevant marketplace, and you can deploy your cluster in
CrateDB Cloud console. This way, your bill can be managed in your preferred
marketplace, instead of directly in Cloud console.
