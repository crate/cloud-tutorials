Deploy a cluster via the Marketplace offers
===========================================

Here you can find the tutorials for subscribing to CrateDB Cloud via one of the
two supported Marketplace SaaS offers.

Each tutorial is structured as follows. First, it covers the signup through the
platforms of the respective cloud provider. Via either route you then end up at
the CrateDB Cloud Console wizard, where you can configure the essentials: your
organization, project, and cluster. Finally, this process gains you access to
the CrateDB Cloud Console.

To proceed with either tutorial, choose the cloud provider that suits your
needs and follow the steps in the relevant section of the tutorial. Then, in
either case, you will be refered back to the CrateDB Cloud Console to finish
the deployment of your cluster.
