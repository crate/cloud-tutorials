CrateDB Cloud promotions
========================

Crate.io regularly offers promotions, consisting of either free or discounted
offers on CrateDB Cloud database-as-a-service products. Promotions can involve
discounts of up to 100% on any dimensions of the product: for example, there
can be promotions on specific `subscription plans`_ or on `scale units`_ (the
number of nodes in a cluster) within a plan. Promotions may last indefinitely
or for limited periods of time.

Another promotional mechanism that should be useful for testing purposes or for
users new to CrateDB Cloud is our Free trial budget system. This provides you
with a free credit whenever you create a new organization. You can spend this
credit on any CrateDB Cloud development plan you choose.
