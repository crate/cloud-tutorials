CrateDB Cloud promotions
========================

Crate.io regularly offers promotions, consisting of either free or discounted
offers on CrateDB Cloud database-as-a-service products. Promotions can involve
discounts of up to 100% on any dimensions of the product: for example, there
can be promotions on specific `subscription plans`_ or on `scale units`_ (the
number of nodes in a cluster) within a plan. Promotions may last indefinitely
or for limited periods of time.

CrateDB Cloud also offers new users $200 in free credits upon signup. This
credit can be spent on any cluster configuration.
